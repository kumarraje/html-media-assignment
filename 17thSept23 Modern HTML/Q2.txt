HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meaning in HTML or characters that cannot be easily typed directly on a keyboard. 
These entities are especially useful for displaying symbols, special characters, and reserved characters in HTML documents without causing parsing errors or misinterpretation by the browser.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

& - Represents the ampersand symbol (&). This entity is used to display the ampersand character itself or to avoid parsing issues in HTML, 
especially when it appears in URLs or within other entities.

< - Represents the less-than symbol (<). This entity is used to display the less-than sign itself without it being interpreted as the beginning of an HTML tag.

> - Represents the greater-than symbol (>). Similar to the less-than entity, this entity is used to display the greater-than sign itself without it being interpreted as the end of an HTML tag.

" - Represents the double quotation mark ("). This entity is used to display double quotes within attribute values of HTML elements, preventing parsing errors.

© - Represents the copyright symbol (©). This entity is used to display the copyright symbol in HTML documents, 
providing a standardized way to represent it across different platforms and browsers.

These HTML entities are widely used to ensure proper rendering of characters and symbols in HTML documents and to maintain compatibility across various web environments.
