        <p>
            Web development encompasses the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications, utilizing a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. 
            It involves both the frontend, responsible for the visual and interactive elements that users interact with, and the backend, which manages the server-side logic and database interactions.<br/> 
            Frontend development typically involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while backend development often includes languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or JavaScript (Node.js), along with frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, or Laravel.
            Additionally, web developers often work with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, and deploy their applications using platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku. 
            Web development is an ever-evolving field, with new technologies and best practices continually emerging to meet the demands of an increasingly digital world.
